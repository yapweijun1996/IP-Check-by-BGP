# BGP.he.net IP Redirect Demo

This is a simple webpage that lets you enter an IP address and redirects you to the Hurricane Electric BGP Toolkit page for that IP.

## How to use

1. Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser.  
2. Enter an IPv4 or IPv6 address in the input box.  
3. Click Submit, and you will be taken to the BGP.he.net page for that IP.

## Notes

- The site validates that your input looks like a valid IP address before redirecting.  
- No server or installation is needed; itâ€™s a static HTML page.
